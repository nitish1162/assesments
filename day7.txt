Question1. Write a program in the following steps:
a. Generates 10 Random 3 Digit number.
b. Store this random numbers into a array.
c. Then find the 2nd largest and the 2nd smallest element without sorting the array.
Ans:

MAXCOUNT=10
count=1
#Array name is number

while [ "$count" -le $MAXCOUNT ]; do
 number[$count]=$(( ( RANDOM % 10 ) + 100 ))
 let "count += 1"
done

echo "${number[*]}"

largest=${number[0]}
secondGreatest='unset'

for((i=1; i < ${#number[@]}; i++))
do
  if [[ ${number[i]} > $largest ]]
  then
    secondGreatest=$largest
    largest=${number[i]}
  elif (( ${number[i]} != $largest )) && { [[ "$secondGreatest" = "unset" ]] || [[ ${number[i]} > $secondGreatest ]]; }
  then
    secondGreatest=${number[i]}
  fi
done

echo "secondGreatest = $secondGreatest"

Question2. Extend the above program to sort the array and then find the 2nd largest and the 2nd smallest element.
Ans:
MAXCOUNT=10
count=1
#Array name is number

while [ "$count" -le $MAXCOUNT ]; do
 number[$count]=$(( ( RANDOM % 10 ) + 100 ))
 let "count += 1"
done

echo "${number[*]}"

secondGreatest=$(printf '%s\n' "${number[@]}" | sort -nu | tail -2 | head -1)
echo "Second Greatest element is " $secondGreatest

secondSmallest=$(printf '%s\n' "${number[@]}" | sort -nu | head -2 | tail -1)
echo "Second Smallest element is " $secondSmallest

Question3. Extend the Prime Factorization Program to store all the Prime Factors of a number n into an array and finally display the output.
